Working in Progress!

Will further elaborate during Winter Holidays

Things to cover:

* Introduction to Bayesian statistics
* Variational Inference
* KL Divergence
* Mean Field Variational Inference
* Expectation-Maximization
* Gaussian Mixture Models
* Inverse Transform Sampling
* Rejection Sampling
* Importance Sampling
* Monte Carlo
* Markov Chains
* Markov Chain Monte Carlo
* Metropolis Hastings
* Gibbs Sampling
* Hamilton Markov Chain
...

I have made brief summary before writing!

1. Variational Inference : [Variational Inference](https://github.com/a2ran/generative_models/blob/main/brief_summary.ipynb)
2. EM algorithms and GMM : [Expectation-Maximization](https://github.com/a2ran/generative_models/blob/main/brief_summary(EM).ipynb)
3. Sampling Methods : [Sampling Methods](https://github.com/a2ran/generative_models/blob/main/brief_summary(Sampling%20Methods).ipynb)
